Every career is a journey, filled with challenges, growth, and those significant moments that mark a shift in our path. Today, I’m excited to share that I’ve arrived at a new milestone in my career—one that is both a culmination of past experiences and a stepping stone toward future aspirations.

## Reflecting on the Journey So Far

My journey began with a passion for learning and a curiosity about the world of hacking. I started with the Red Team Hacker Academy in my locality, but it wasn’t the right fit for me. I turned to self-learning through Google and YouTube, which became my primary resources. During this time, I realized that the foundation of everything I was exploring was programming.

I dived into programming through YouTube, where I discovered the Brototype channel and its inspiring founder, Nikhil Kilivayil. This channel introduced me to the basics of coding in C. My breakthrough came when I attended a four-day workshop with Nikhil Sir and other Brocamp members. That experience transformed my perspective and gave me the confidence to move forward.

## Taking the First Steps

After successfully passing a fumigation test on my first attempt with good marks, I decided to pursue the MERN stack and enrolled in Brocamp. 

The first two weeks were focused on HTML and CSS, which were relatively simple. But things got intense when the first domain week began. Week three was JavaScript week, and it was a challenging phase for me. Despite facing setbacks and earning a three-week back, I persevered and built a strong foundation in JavaScript.

## The Grind: Building Skills and Projects

The subsequent weeks brought new challenges with Node.js, MongoDB, and the introduction of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I worked tirelessly on projects and managed to pass most evaluations on the first try, with occasional week backs and extensions. 

One of my first projects was building a DSA-focused application. These projects allowed me to apply what I learned and gain hands-on experience.

## The Unique Brocamp Experience

What sets Brocamp apart is its rigorous review and passing system. Each week, an experienced reviewer conducts interviews and assigns tasks to test our skills. Passing these reviews is critical, as failing means repeating the week. This system instills discipline and ensures that every concept is well-understood.

Additionally, Brocamp has helped me overcome a major personal challenge—communication. I initially struggled with speaking and expressing myself in English. However, through daily one-hour communication sessions, I’ve improved significantly. I’m now more confident in my ability to speak English and engage in meaningful conversations.

## Where I Stand Now

I’m currently in Week 14, delving deep into DSA. It’s a challenging yet rewarding phase of my journey. With each passing week, I’m not just learning technical skills but also growing as an individual.

## Looking Ahead

While I’m proud of how far I’ve come, I know this is just one milestone in a much larger journey. The road ahead is filled with exciting possibilities, and I’m eager to continue pushing boundaries, learning new things, and contributing to meaningful projects. If there’s one thing I’ve learned along the way, it’s that every new milestone is not an end, but rather a launchpad for the next chapter.

Thank you for being part of this journey with me, and here’s to the adventures yet to come!
