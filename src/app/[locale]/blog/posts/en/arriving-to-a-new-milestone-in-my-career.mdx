Every career is a journey with challenges, growth, and moments that shape our path. Today, I’m excited to share that I’ve reached a new milestone in my career. This moment reflects my past efforts and opens doors to new opportunities.

## Reflecting on My Journey

My journey began with a passion for learning and exploring hacking. I first joined the Red Team Hacker Academy in my hometown, but it wasn’t the right fit. So, I turned to self-learning through Google and YouTube, which became my main resources. Along the way, I realized that programming was the key to everything I wanted to explore.

I started programming through YouTube and discovered the Brototype channel and its founder, Nikhil Kilivayil. Their videos helped me learn the basics of coding in C. The turning point came when I attended a four-day workshop with Nikhil Sir and the Brocamp team. This experience gave me the confidence to continue.

## Taking the First Steps

After passing a fumigation test on my first try with good marks, I decided to learn the MERN stack and joined Brocamp.

The first two weeks focused on HTML and CSS, which were easy to understand. But things got harder when JavaScript week started. It was tough, and I earned a three-week back, but I didn’t give up. Eventually, I built a strong foundation in JavaScript.

## Learning and Growing

The next weeks introduced me to Node.js, MongoDB, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I worked on projects and passed most evaluations on the first attempt, though there were occasional setbacks.

One of my first projects was creating an application focused on DSA. These projects allowed me to apply what I learned and gain practical experience.

## The Brocamp Experience

What makes Brocamp special is its review system. Each week, experienced reviewers test our skills through interviews and tasks. Passing these reviews is crucial; failing means repeating the week. This process taught me discipline and ensured I fully understood each concept.

Brocamp also helped me improve my communication skills. At first, I found it hard to speak English, but daily one-hour communication sessions boosted my confidence. Now, I can express myself clearly and participate in meaningful conversations.

## Where I Am Now

I’m currently in Week 14, learning more about DSA. It’s challenging but rewarding. Every week, I grow not only in technical knowledge but also as a person.

## Looking Ahead

While I’m proud of what I’ve achieved, I know this is just the beginning. I’m excited to keep learning, take on new challenges, and work on meaningful projects. Every milestone is not an end—it’s a new start for the next chapter.

Thank you for being part of my journey. I look forward to sharing more adventures with you!
