Life has a way of weaving the most beautiful friendships, and today, I want to share a story close to my heart. It's about my school days, the golden moments of my childhood, and a special bond with someone who’s more than a friend—a part of my soul.

## Early School Days: A Journey Begins

From 1st to 7th grade, I attended our nearest school. Transitioning from LP (Lower Primary) to UP (Upper Primary) in 5th grade was a big step. I’d already been part of that school, but after 4th grade, many new students joined from other LP schools. These were truly golden days, filled with friendships, programs, teachers, homework, playful fights, and all the joys of a funny, carefree school life.

## Moving On: The End of an Era

After 7th grade, everyone went to different high schools. Some friends stayed in my class as I moved to a government school near my place. Among them was my best friend—a curly-haired, pretty girl with small eyes. This blog is dedicated to her, my best friend, a person whose character and charm have left an everlasting impression on me.

## High School: Bonding Through Time

From 8th to 10th grade, we remained close friends, sharing everything. I was a hyperactive person back then, well-known among friends and even teachers. Life felt vibrant and full of connections.

Then came the turning point—COVID-19. The pandemic brought lockdowns, restrictions, and online classes. Friendships were tested as contact with others became difficult. However, my best friend and I stayed connected. Every day, she messaged me, and we shared details about our lives. We studied together and stayed in touch through WhatsApp.

## The Impact of COVID-19: A Changed World

COVID affected me deeply, not just physically but mentally. I became socially anxious, almost introverted, during my +1 and +2 years. Those years felt like a waste, with only a few friends to lean on. Despite this, she was my constant companion. She listened to my feelings and supported me when I needed it most.

During that time, I found some solace in the NSS (National Service Scheme). It provided a space where I could share, enjoy good moments, and feel comfortable.

## A New Chapter: Choosing Our Paths

After my +2, I aimed to crack the NEET exam and secure a seat in agriculture. However, I realized my true passion lay in technology. I chose a career in cybersecurity, while she pursued nursing. Despite our different paths, we remained close friends, supporting each other through life’s challenges.

## What She Means to Me

Even now, she’s in Bangalore studying nursing, while I’m here in Brocamp, immersed in learning and working 24/7. Despite our busy schedules, we always make time to connect—messaging each other, sharing our lives, and being there for one another. She encourages and supports me, especially during tough times, and I do the same for her.

## A Bond Beyond Words

She’s not just a friend or a crush; she’s my best friend—a unique and irreplaceable presence in my life. In my eyes, she’s the most beautiful person I’ve ever met, with her curly hair and kind heart. No one compares to her. If I see someone, I inevitably compare them to her, and they never measure up.

## The Future: An Uncertain but Cherished Friendship

I know this bond may not last forever. One day, she’ll find a life partner, and our friendship might change. But that’s okay. I’ll always cherish the time we spent together and the impact she’s had on my life. I’ve never met anyone like her, and I doubt I ever will.

She’s my best friend, and this blog is my way of saying thank you for everything.
